# CObjectGraph

This project is designed to help generate GraphViz graphs for C/C++ objects. This could be useful in visualizing objects in memory to help with teaching data structures and algorithms. It could also be used as a debugging tool in certain situations.

The output generated by `CObjectGraph::Graph` is in the DOT language i.e. the language used by GraphViz to describe any graph. The output can be fed to GraphViz to generate an image. GraphViz supports many output formats including PNG and SVG.

See examples for details.
